# Differential Expression

## Basic Concepts of DESeq

```R
deg <- DESeq(dds)

```

1. **estimating size factors**
2. estimating dispersions
3. gene-wise **dispersion estimates**
4. mean-dispersion relationship
5. final dispersion estimates
6. **fitting model and testing**

##  Quality Check 

1. PCA

   ```R
   vsd <- vst(deg, blind = FALSE)
   plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = "dexamethasone")
   ```



2. Inspecting Size Factor

â€‹	Check whether one sample is sequenced more/less deeply than the other.

```R
sizeFactors(deg)

output: 
SRR1039508 SRR1039509 SRR1039512 SRR1039513 SRR1039516 SRR1039517 SRR1039520 SRR1039521 
 1.0236476  0.8961327  1.1795171  0.6700291  1.1776714  1.3990527  0.9208046  0.9445520 
```



3. Dispersion Plot

```
plotDispEsts(deg)

```

The dispersion plot, typically with the final dispersion estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates

towards the fitted estimate. As you know it very well that the red line which is here in the center of the plot, is a fitted curve. So normally the gene dispersion should be shrunk towards this future line.

If this fitted line is not showing a downward trend, that it means that there is some abnormality in

the data and we need to check it out.

Once again, if the red line is showing the downward trend, then this is a good indication that we

have a good differential expression of the genes data.
